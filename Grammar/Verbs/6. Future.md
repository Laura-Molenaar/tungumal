As you know, this is how you speak about the future in English:
This movie will be great!
I will go to university next year.
Will we be flying with WOW air?

In Icelandic, the will is not necessary at all. Instead, you speak the same way as if you were speaking about the present, it is obvious by context if you are actually talking about the future.
Þessi mynd verður frábær! = This movie becomes great! = This movie will be great!
Ég fer í háskóla á næsta ári = I go to university next year = I will go to university next year.
Fljúgum við með WOW air? = We fly with WOW air? = Will we be flying with WOW air?

There does exist another way to speak about future. It looks like the same as the English version:
Mengunin mun hafa áhrif á sjávarlífið = The pollution will influence marine life.
Hún mun ekki leggja fram kæru = She will not bring charges.
Ríkisstjórnin mun hækka skatta = The government will increase taxes.

This version is much rarer. It is mainly used:
in formal language
when you really need to emphasize that it will happen

So for you as a student, you only need to recognize the mun when you see it, but you almost never have to use it yourself. At this point you only need to use the present when speaking about future.
