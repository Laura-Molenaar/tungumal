Now you will be introduced to some basic aspects of Icelandic grammar.
You do not need to memorize these for now, but you do need to be aware of them.
2.1. Gender
In many European languages such as French, German, and Russian, words have a gender.
Gender is an important aspect of the Icelandic language, where all nouns are
he 👨🏻, she 👩🏼, or it 👶🏼.

But why do the words have gender? The answer to that question isn't really known, they just do. The gender of a word affects other words in a sentence, such as adjectives and pronouns. We will see some examples shortly.

Have a look at some words of different genders:
He – Male
She – Female
It – Neuter
maður (man)
fótur (foot)
stóll (chair)
köttur (cat)
kona (woman)
tunga (tongue)
mjólk (milk)
peysa (sweater)
barn (child)
gras (grass)
hús (house)
ljós (light)

Sadly for you, it's not really possible to know a word's gender just by looking at it. Sometimes it is. Most words ending in -ur or in a double consonant (-ll, -nn) will be masculine, for example. And most words ending in -ing and -un are feminine. But don't be stressed – you will slowly learn them by seeing how they're used. Slowly you will start recognizing the patterns and then you don't even need to think about gender – you just know.

See the effect a word's gender has on the rest of the sentence:
Hvað er kötturinn {kk} þinn {kk} gamall {kk}? How old is your cat?
Hvað er peysan {kvk} þín {kvk} gömul {kvk}? How old is your sweater?
Hvað er húsið {hk} þitt {hk} gamalt {hk}? How old is your house?
2.2. The "the"
Have a look at these sentences:
I bought a new car.
Mary is an American.
I am a dancer.
Ég keypti nýjan bíl.
María er Ameríkani.
Ég er dansari.

As you noticed, there is no "a / an" in Icelandic.
Although Icelandic doesn't have "a", it does have "the" (definite article). But unlike English, the "the" comes after the word:
This is a cat.
The cat is gone.

Here is a computer.
The computer is expensive.

I own a house.
The house is big.
Þetta er köttur.
Kötturinn er farinn.

Hérna er tölva.
Tölvan er dýr.

Ég á hús.
Húsið er stórt.

The "the" doesn't always look the same. Have a look at some different ways the "the" can look:
Example male article
Example female article
Example neuter article
a dog
hundur
hund
hundi
hunds
the dog
hundurinn
hundinn
hundinum
hundsins
dogs
hundar
hunda
hundum
hunda
the dogs
hundarnir
hundana
hundunum
hundanna

Hús

Húsi
Húss
The house
Húsið
Húsið
Húsinu
Hússins
Houses




You do not need to memorize these endings for now. We just want to show you how the definite article changes with gender and with different cases.
2.3. Cases
Words can change depending on what's happening to them. English no longer has cases, except for some pronouns like "he". Notice how the word "he" can change depending on what's happening to it:
He is my brother.
I like him.
His hair is red.
This happens in Icelandic for every noun, pronoun, and adjective.
See how the word "cat" can change:
Þessi köttur er sætur.
Mig langar að eiga svona kött.
Ég hef aldrei haldið á ketti.
Getum við labbað til þessa kattar og klappað honum?
Some words change a lot:
ég
mig
mér
mín
But some words only change a little:
pabbi
pabba
pabba
pabba
There are 4 cases in Icelandic. They will always be shown to you in the following table:
🙂  Being (nominative)
😥  Suffering  (accusative)
🎁  Getting  (dative)
🤑  Owning (genitive)




Finding the different cases of a word is finding it's declension. To make it easier to know a word's declension we use the following helper words:
🙂  hér er = here is
😥  um = about
🎁  frá = from
🤑  til = to
These helper words will always be shown in the declension table, to make declensing easier.
Have a look at some words and see how they change. You do not need to memorize this, we just want to show you:
hér er ég
um mig
frá mér
til mín
hér er köttur
um kött
frá ketti
til kattar
hér er mamma
um mömmu
frá mömmu
til mömmu
hér er hús
um hús
frá húsi
til húss
With time, you will become very familiar with this table. Knowing which case to use in a sentence and knowing what the case looks like is not always easy. You will make many errors when declensing, especially as a beginner. But slowly, you'll become better. Don't worry. Declensing incorrectly is okay, especially at the beginning. You can make yourself understood with errors. Only with practice, by speaking with people and making many errors, will you become good.
Later on in this course, we will teach you how to know a word's case.
