The emphasis is always at the start of a word. Read this sentence and notice where the emphasis is:
G√≥√∞an daginn. G√¶ti √©g fengi√∞ fisk dagsins?
Double L
The double L is a bit tricky to pronounce. It sounds like [tl], similar to the word bu[tl]er.
Listen:
s√¶ll, vill, kalla, b√≠ll, ull, bolli
But sometimes the double L isn't pronounced as [tl], but like the English [ll]. It is not always obvious when the double L is pronounced in which way. When in doubt, assume it is [tl]. The double L is pronounced [ll] only when words are 1) cute, 2) nicknames, or 3) foreign words.
hall√≥, Kalli, n√∫ll, bolla, ball
