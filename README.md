# Tungumál 🇮🇸

Status: `In progress`

This project will contain articles explaining Icelandic grammar and culture.


## Aim

The aim of this project is to:

- Have bitesized articles about Icelandic grammar and culture.
- Be written in a very accessible English with limited grammatical words

## How to write

This guide is written in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

In addition to the markdown changes, these will be added later:

- **`{kk}` `{kvk}` `{hk}`** will be converted to the emojis 👨🏻👩🏼👶🏼
- **`{nf}` `{þf}` `{þgf}` `{ef}`** will be converted to the emojis 🙂😥🎁🤑

Use `<!-- Note: blabla -->` or  `<!-- Todo: blabla -->` to add coments to your writing.
